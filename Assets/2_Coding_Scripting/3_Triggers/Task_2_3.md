# Instantiating (Creating) Objects through code

You need to be able to write code that can move a player object around on the scene.

This task builds on from [`Task_2_1`](../1_Moving_Player/Task_2_1.md)

## Tasks
1. Open the scene `Task_2_3`. The `PlayerInput` components and input actions have already been added for you.
2. Create a tag called `Checkpoint` and attach this to the cubes in each corner
3. Create a script called `PlayerCollision`
4. Attach the script to the player
